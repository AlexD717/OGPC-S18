# No Safe Harbor
No Safe Harbor is a game for the Oregon Game Project Challenge for Season 18
A storm is approaching fast, and it's up to you to warn the port before it hits. You're at the helm of a nimble sailboat with a dynamically adjustable sail system that responds to realistic wind physics. Use your map to chart a precise course, then skillfully navigate the waters, dodging islands and obstacles as you race against time to deliver the warning.
